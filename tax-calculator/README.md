# Tax Calculation Process

Tax calculation process is not so complex as many people think it to be, here I have discussed the steps how income tax is calculated

#Step 1 ðŸ‘‡

First of all note down the annual gross salary you receive. This will include all the components of the salary including all kinds of allowances.
Now the exemptions have to be taken out that are being provided on the salary components.
The exemptions that are granted majorly include HRA(House Rent Allowance) and LTA(Leave Travel Allowance) . now HRA can be claimed only when you are living in a rented house and you can submit receipts as proof.
However if you aren't living in arented house then hra is fully taxable, if the taxpayer is living in a metro city then it's 50 percent of taxpayer's salary and 40 percent if he's from a non metro city.

#Step 2 ðŸ‘‡

Next eliminate the tax deductions, the thing that comes first is Rs. 50,000 standard deduction which can be attained by each and every salaried individual. Next all the investment and the expenses that fall under Section 80 has to be removed.

#Step 3 ðŸ‘‡

By subtracting all the entitled deductions from the total taxable income, you wouuld arrive at your total income on which you need to pay tax on the basis of tax slab that's being fixed by the country you are belonging to.

#Step 4 ðŸ‘‡

Now the tax paid on the taxable income depends on the following factors:

For first Rs. 2.5 lakh of your taxable income you pay zero tax.
For next Rs. 2.5 lakhs you pay 5% i.e. Rs.12,500
For next 5 lakhs you pay 20% i.e. Rs.1,00,000
For the taxable income part taht exceeds Rs. 10 lakhs you pay 30% of the entire amount.


#Step 5 ðŸ‘‡

Now individuals those who are earning below a specified limit tax rebate under section 87A is being provided by the government, however those who earn in very high income bracket they pay a surcharge of 10%
#Sample Example to see how the calculation of tax occurs ðŸ‘‡

Let's consider Ram works at a MNC and his annual total salary is Rs 20 lakh. After removing all exemptions from his salary, including HRA and standard deductions, his net salary is Rs 17.5 lakh.

Last year, he earned Rs 30,000 as interest income from his bank account. And his total investment in ELSS Mutual Funds and contribution to EPF combined come to Rs 2.5 lakh. He has even invested in NPS (Rs 30,000) and has a health insurance policy for himself for which he pays 25,000 premium every year.

Now the image given above properly documents the process of tax calculation, all the data that are shown in red are to be known as deductions. All the deductions that come under Section 80 are to be removed and the total income is calculated. then finally the tax is calculated.
